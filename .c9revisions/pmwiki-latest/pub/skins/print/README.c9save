You can then configure PmWiki to use your modified layout\nfiles by setting $ActionSkin['print'] to the name of your new skin.\nFor example, if you copy your custom print skin to pub/skins/custom, \nthen you would set\n   $ActionSkin['print'] = 'custom';\nin local/config.php.\n\nThe files in this directory:\n    print.tmpl    -- the default template for ?action=print\n    print.css     -- the print template's css\n    print.php     -- loaded when the skin is loaded, it redefines the link\n                     formats to a form better suited for printing\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":941}]],"length":941}
